<h3 class="text-left">The Game</h3>
<p class="text-left">This first version is less of a game and more of a simulator that describes how a girl's body, habits and weight change over time.</p>
<p class="text-left">In the future, I plan to give the player the ability to influence the girl's habits and will through a set of strategies, create random life events that influence her gain to create actual challenge, and add a few story events at certain benchmarks in the game.</p>
<p class="text-left">I'd love to hear thoughts and take feedback/ideas but please keep in mind my skill set. I'm an excellent programmer, a mediocre writer and a terrible artist. So I tend to focus on functionality/mechanics over lots of unique story text or art.</p>

<h3 class="text-left">How to Play</h3>
<p class="text-left">Basically just set the inputs and press start. Right now it runs the simulation without the player having any further influence. You can press the different button to skip over length's of time and see what happens.</p>

<h3 class="text-left">How the Game Works</h3>
<p class="text-left">Will: Determines how quickly bad habits are lost/resisted.</p>
<p class="text-left">Addiction: Determines how quickly bad habits are formed. Also creates a chance for "Addiction Events" to happen.</p>
<p class="text-left">Fitness: Determines the maximum level of workout habit (ie to do an HIT workout, has to at least be in good shape, etc).</p>
<p class="text-left">Habits: Habits are 95% of how weight gain/weight loss happens. Each type of habit has several levels. Higher levels of a habit cause increasingly unhealthy behavior.</p>
